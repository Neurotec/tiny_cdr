TinyCDR is a simple app for pushing FreeSWITCH xml_cdr records into both a 
PostgreSQL (or other Sequel-supported db) and CouchDB data store.  The Sequel record is just 
the basics and the couch record is the exact xml as POSTed by FreeSWITCH's mod_xml_cdr.  
This is fresh stuff, very few docs.  The web side is a ramaze app, start with

ruby start.rb

and point FreeSWITCH's mod_xml_curl at the url it tells you it's listening on.

To import a single record, use

ruby -r ./app -r 'Call.create_from_xml(File.read("/path/to/the/xml/file.xml"))'
